# Demo projects.
 
 This repository contains two packages. Both are catkin packages so needs [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) and [catkin_workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace) to build.

## Data Structure.

 This is a catkin package that can perform insertion sort for numbers, character and string. This has been done using generic function written in functions.cpp in include folder. In the main function these generic functions have been called for intergers, charactes, string for demo.
